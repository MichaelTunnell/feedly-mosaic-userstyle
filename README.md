## Mosaic Userstyle for Feedly

The outstanding [RSS Reader](http://youtu.be/0klgLsSxGsU) app called [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) released a new version of the app with v14. Version 14 comes with a lot of new features, bug fixes, speed improvements and much more but unfortunately they decided to kill the "Mosaic" view (Grid) from v14. Feedly decided to replace the "Mosaic" view (my preferred view) with a new "Cards" view which essentially was an attempt to do the vertical column layout style made famous by [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/). In my opinion, and many others, this was a mistake. I decided to create a userstyle with the browser addon, [Stylish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylish). Before we get to the userstyle that I created and the reasons of why I created it...you should first know what a Userstyle is and what Stylish is.
