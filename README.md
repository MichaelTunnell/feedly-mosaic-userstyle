## Mosaic Userstyle for Feedly<a name="description"></a>

The outstanding [RSS Reader](http://youtu.be/0klgLsSxGsU) app called [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) released a new version of the app with v14. Version 14 comes with a lot of new features, bug fixes, speed improvements and much more but unfortunately they decided to kill the "Mosaic" view (Grid) from v14. Feedly decided to replace the "Mosaic" view (my preferred view) with a new "Cards" view which essentially was an attempt to do the vertical column layout style made famous by [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/). In my opinion, and many others, this was a mistake. I decided to create a userstyle with the browser addon, [Stylish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylish). Before we get to the userstyle that I created and the reasons of why I created it...you should first know what a Userstyle is and what Stylish is.

#### What is Stylish?<a name="stylish"></a>

Stylish is an extension for Firefox & Google Chrome that allows a user to manipulate the look of a website by altering the CSS of the site. These alterations only apply to the user who has the extension installed and a userstyle installed, it does not actually affect the site itself. You may have heard of the extension "Greasemonkey" which does the same thing but uses javascript instead of CSS.

#### What is a Userstyle?

A userstyle is a collection of CSS code that is installed via Stylish in order to manipulate a site for various reasons. Using a userstyle allows you to alter a site and keep the modifications over multiple sessions so you only have to activate it once to use it over and over.

#### Why I created this userstyle:

Feedly replaced Mosaic with Cards and as I said before...Cards is simply a mistake...it looks great on Android but it is just a ton of wasted space on the desktop versions of Feedly. Below I have provided screenshots of both Cards and my new Mosaics view. Feedly's original Mosaic view did not look like what mine does but it was close enough.
